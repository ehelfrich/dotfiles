********************************************** HOW TO INSTALL *********************************************
Steps to install i3, i3-gaps, themes, and other misc. programs for first Rice on ubuntu 14.04 LTS

General Notes:
-The config file for i3 refers to a config file for the i3status; you will need one
in order for the i3bar to work properly (one is provided in the dotfile for you)

Step one:

-Install the i3 window manager either through the ubuntu repos with the command
> sudo apt-get install i3
-or visit the i3 website https://i3wm.org/ for a more up to date version or other OS's

Step two:

-Once i3 is installed launch the windows manager either through a login manager or editing the config files
for a bare bones linux install
-Once launched allow i3 to create the config file and select your modifier key
-the config file will be located in ~/.i3
 
Step three: 
-Install i3-gaps to allow for space in between the windows
-IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS OR CANNOT INSTALL i3-gaps THEN YOU WILL NEED TO COMMENT OUT
THE LINES IN ~/.i3/config THAT ARE USED IN i3-gaps TO PREVENT ERRORS 
-you can install it from https://github.com/Airblader/i3
-follow his readme on the github page to install it (compile from source)
-for ubuntu 14.04 LTS there is no config file to run so install all the dependencies that are listed
on his wiki through the README for your OS using the sudo # apt-get install command
